# Answering the 5 Ws of Epidemiology: 
## Who, What, When, Where and Why/How

### 1. Who - The patients
   * Clinical case distribution across ages

### 2. What - The clinical manifestations
   * Clinical case distribution and clinical outcome 
   
### 3. When - Time of the event
   * Temporal singal of clinical cases: Time series
  
### 4. Where - Geographical location
   * Spatial distribution of clinical cases

### 5. Why/How - Transmission paths
  * Identifying transmission food vehicles (Food sampling sources)
