# Answering the 5 Ws of Epidemiology: 
## Who, What, When, Where and Why/How

### 1. Who - The patients
   * Clinical case distribution across ages

### 2. What - The clinical manifestations
   * Clinical case distribution and clinical outcome 
   
### 3. When - Time of the event
   * Temporal singal of clinical cases: Time series
  
### 4. Where - Geographical location
   * Spatial distribution of clinical cases

### 5. Why/How - Transmission paths
  * Identifying transmission food vehicles (Food sampling sources)

    

# epidemological-visualisations
Analysis that permits visualisation of the patterns, causes and effects of diseases. The code presented here has been applied to answer questions on *Listeria monocytogenes* however the same approach can be applied to investigate other pathogens.


# Input data structure
The analysis can work with any form of genomic classification and cluster intedification methods, however in this instance SNP-calling (column "SNP" in the human data file) was utilised and clusters were identified at a 5 SNP single linlage distance level (column "Cluster Level" in the human data file).
